Innovative Idea:
In order to meet the housing needs of college students, our team plans to coordinate the demand analysis and development and design of the housing rental mini program, and be responsible for connecting with customers and marketing, such as promoting around the campus, raising project funds and other key development of apartments around the campus, discussing cooperation and communication with major developers and property developers.

 Important Components:
 Purpose and benefits:
 1. Address housing needs of current students or others.
 2. Create profits: Cooperate with major real estate agents to help them find consumers, and we can also get $500 per commission. (After many inquiries and comparing the prices of all the apartments around the campus. It was found that the prices of all residential properties in the neighborhood remained between $1000 to $1500/person/room/month. For example, the rent of Olympia Place for 4b4b is $1000 /person/month. The housing contract has a promotional clause: If the resident invites one person into the area, he/she will get $500 back. 
 3. Preferential Policies:
 a)    If the client is willing to use my web platform, our platform can offer a monthly rent discount of   $100 for the apartment under the property.  
 b)    If the number of clients through the app of this platform reaches 5, our website platform is willing to offer him one-month free. 
 We make use of the theory of consumer psychology to make customers feel satisfied with their consumption. Let them accept and satisfied to consume our products and take our channels.

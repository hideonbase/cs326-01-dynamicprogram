In case you don't know who wrote those code. It me Jianye Nie.

I have 3 html page.

First is sign up, it is easy to understand, just create a account and send back to the data. (CRUD - C)

Second, I have login page (signin). Just log in a account. I guess it is part of read. If it is not part of the read, lets check the last html page.

The last, UserInfo. After you login, you suppose to go back to the main page, but I don't have the main page code, so I just location.href to the USERinfo Page.
In this page, you can read the user infomation (CRUD - R). 
              you can update the user name (not the user id) (CRUD - U)
              you can delete the account (CRUD - D)
